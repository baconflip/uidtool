# uidtool
Designed for jamfConnect Macs. The desired outcome of using this tool is that if a user changes their domain account outside of the Mac, their local account will be removed after every logout or reboot, while still preserving their home folder and files so subsequent logins will relink their local account to their previously created home folder with correct permissions.
